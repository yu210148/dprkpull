Nothing much to say here just keep the files in the same directory
make the dprk_pull.sh and the kcna-parse-links.php files executable:

	chmod u+x ./dprk_pull.sh
        chmod u+x ./kcna-parse-links.php

The script also is expecting a writable ~/kcna directory. 

TODO: write an installer script to check for the dependencies and create the ~/kcna directory.

then run dprk_pull.sh

./dprk_pull.sh



DEPENDENCIES:
There are a few dependencies:
        awk
        bash
        kwrite
        php
        sed
        wget


TODO:
        Have it pull the articles in the right order.  Seems to pull them from last to first now.

        Get it to remove the big gaps in between the articles.  Not a huge deal as the TTS just
        skips over them but it'd be nice.

        Could get it to pipe straight into festival for tts rather than open in kwrite but I like
        the visual elements of the KDE Text-to-Speech Manager (KTTSMgr).  If the output could go
        straight into there that'd be good.

	Find a way to stop it pulling the Spanish lanugage articles.


DISCLAIMER
I have nothing to do with the KCNA or DPRK (North Korea).
