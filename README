A while ago the KCNA (www.kcna.co.jp) changed from putting their 
English language news articles
in one big file to several little ones.  I wrote this script to recombine them into one file for
reading by a Text To Speech (TTS) program.

INSTAL:
To install run the install.sh script.  This script will remove an existing ~/kcna directory to get
rid of any old versions that are installed.  It will then create a blank ~/kcna directory and 
copy the necessary files to it.

TODO: MAKE THE INSTALLER SCRIPT CHECK FOR DEPENDENCIES

USAGE:
To use just run the ~/kcna/dprk_pull.sh file.  NOTE: you may have to change the permissions on it to make it executable:

	chmod u+x ./dprk_pull.sh

The php file needs to be executable as well.

	chmod u+x ./kcna-parse-links.php



DEPENDENCIES:
There are a few dependencies:
	awk
	bash
	kwrite
	php
	sed
	wget
	dos2unix
	kdialog
	firefox (optional) 
	
OPTIONS:
There is now a commented line in dprk_pull.sh that if uncommented
will launch firefox and display a Google translated (to English) version of the KCNA's/KNS's images
page located at http://kns-photo.com/index.php


TODO:
	Have it pull the articles in the right order.  Seems to pull them from last to first now.

	Get it to remove the big gaps in between the articles.  Not a huge deal as the TTS just
	skips over them but it'd be nice. --Done March 7 2009 

	Could get it to pipe straight into festival for tts rather than open in kwrite but I like
	the visual elements of the KDE Text-to-Speech Manager (KTTSMgr).  If the output could go 
	straight into there that'd be good.

	Find a way to have it stop pulling the Spanish lanugage articles.

	I'm not really happy with what I'm doing with xmessage but it 
	was the easiest way to get informational messages to the user
	if the user is running it (as I do) from a graphical icon in
	KDE (or presumably GNOME for that matter).  I'm open to
	suggestions on how this could be done better.
		Update on this: I've been playing around with Qt4 and have replaced
		xmessage with Qt windows that display the notifications.
		The good news is they look better than the xmessage windows.  The bad
		news is that I haven't yet figured out how to make the close on their
		own.  Or better yet display what's happening in one window as it happens.
			Okay, got this working nicely with kdialog this morning. 
			I'll leave the previous ways of doing this commented in the script so 
			I can look back and laugh at myself. :)
			

DISCLAIMER
I have nothing to do with the KCNA or the DPRK (North Korea).
