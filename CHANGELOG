CHANGELOG for dprk_pull


Note I'm a little late getting this file started.  It probably should've been in the first code upload
but better late than never so we'll start with changes from version 0.03

Apr 18:
Changed the README and INSTALL files to not duplicate information.  I've left the dependency
listing in both files just because it is really important that the dependencies be met.  
Also, added a CHANGELOG file. ;)

WOW haven't been keeping up with this have I?  Okay, re-did how the notifications were
done using kdialog this time to produce a progress bar.

I think there were some other changes that I can't think of now.  Check the news section on 
the project's Sourceforge pages for details

Today I just made a minor change changing the name of the final news file that gets loaded
into kwrite from 3newsfile.txt to KCNA_News.txt.

June 13th
There were some changes made on the KNS/KCNA's side to the formating and file names of their files
This version accounts for that.  One of the changes was that the file e-news.htm had been renamed
to e-news.html.  There were also some formatting changes in that file that are accounted for now.

In addition to that there's now a commented line in dprk_pull.sh that if uncommented
will launch firefox and display a Google translated (to English) version of the KCNA's/KNS's images
page located at http://kns-photo.com/index.php

Jan 18 2010
Did some clean up in the main script.  All the commented out lines related to older ways
of doing the notification calls were making the file cluttered.  I also standardised the
line spacing and added some comments at the beginning about the two features disabled by
default. (i.e., the kcna images display and the direct piping to festival).

Apr. 22 2010
Added Copyright notices in all files that didn't have one.  This does not in
anyway change the licence that dprkpull is licenced under.  For more info on
that see COPYING.  For more information on why I'm doing this listen to FLOSS
Weekley 117: Bob Jacobsen.  That is an interview with a guy who did some model
train software and ended up in a multi-year legal battle!  --KL

Oh, and for the record...

I also changed the last line in the install script which suggested that
running ./dprk_pull.sh would launch the program when really the whole point of
running the install script was to put the whole thing into ~/kcna.  Sorry, my
bad. :) KL

Aug 30 2011 -- Tidied up the spanish detection so now it's no longer relying on the 
depreciated Google Translate API.  It's cutting out the spanish stories more
reliably now.  Also changed the default configuration to include reading the
stories aloud via festival and opening firefox with the picture page from them open 
piped through Google's online translation.
